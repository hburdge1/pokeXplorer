## Overview

This **PokeXplorer** app is a collaboration between Hannah Burdge and Dylan Dupasquier. It is a combination of both of our phase 1 projects in Flatiron school where we each created Pokedex apps. Both of our apps had very desirable traits, so we decided to combine them, as well as add some other fun features (some still to come)
